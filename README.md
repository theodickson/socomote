TODO
----

- Async usage?
- Fast skipping
- Git!
- Volume in larger increments
- Max action queue length
  - Alternatively, if i can't get cancellable actions in anyway,
    and larger increments sorts the volume, just stop queuing actions,
    may just be too confusing
- Package it
- Proper entrypoint
- Easily cancellable actions
  - I.e. if you repeatedly change station, cancel previous change
- Use timing instead of enter for numbers
  - could then use enter as something else
